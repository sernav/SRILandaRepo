Expert system for music recommendations

Fork of https://github.com/sernav/srimusic-java

# Abstract
The exponential growth of all kind of Internet contents, as well as its huge variety, makes it difficult for us to establish opinions or make preferences on so much infor-mation. To avoid this problem, recommendation systems have been developed tools and techniques that provide useful suggestions for the user. Today, these suggestions make reference to processes involving decision making, especially in consumption, leisure and culture realms. These are processes like which items to buy, which kind of music to lis-tening to, what movie to watch or what news to read.
SriLanda it’s a project that provides a recommendation system for music content adopting an expert role based on fuzzy logic techniques, clúster analysis and algorithms for similarity calculation.
